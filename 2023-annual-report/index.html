                  <h1>1. Introduction
                  </h1>
                  <p>Since its launch in 2017, the Impact and Innovation Unit (IIU) has remained focused on working with federal departments, other levels of government, and external partners to support the implementation of inventive programs and services. Impact Canada was established with a clear goal in mind – <strong>develop new policy and program methods to better address government priorities and make meaningful impacts in the lives of Canadians.</strong> To this end, we have continued to expand our portfolio of Challenges and world-leading behavioural science programs of research in key government priority areas, including climate action, health &amp; public health, housing &amp; infrastructure, and trust &amp; misinformation.
                  </p>
                  <p>Over the past fiscal year, Impact Canada underwent an independent comprehensive 5-year assessment which aimed to determine whether Impact Canada has:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li style="padding-bottom: 0.5em;">met or is on track to meet its strategic objectives,</li>
                    <li style="padding-bottom: 0.5em;">efficient and effective processes in place to achieve goals and objectives, and</li>
                    <li style="padding-bottom: 0.5em;">systems-level impact, including the demand for services, client satisfaction, public sector capacity, and continued need for the work.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>A three-layered approach to data collection and analysis was utilized by the independent evaluators. The lines of evidence included: an extensive review of organizational documentation, interviews with key stakeholders, and a high-level analysis of governance best practices as they pertain to Impact Canada. Further, as part of Impact Canada's ongoing impact measurement efforts, three surveys, conducted between March – April 2022 to assess the impact and effectiveness of Impact Canada Challenges and the Impact Canada Centre of Expertise, were included in the analysis. These surveys included:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li style="padding-bottom: 0.8em;"><strong>Department survey:</strong> Government of Canada staff from departments implementing Challenges (n=47/141)</li>
                    <li style="padding-bottom: 0.8em;"><strong>Jury survey:</strong> Members of expert panels that reviewed and evaluated Challenge applicants (n=93/303)</li>
                    <li style="padding-bottom: 0.5em;"><strong>Challenge applicant survey:</strong> Applicants and participants in Challenges including successful and unsuccessful applicants (n=426/2,521)</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p><strong style="font-size:1.2em;">We are proud to share the key findings of the comprehensive assessment in our 2022-2023 Annual Report.</strong>

                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li style="padding-bottom: 0.5em;">Impact Canada represents a <strong>unique and effective approach</strong> to solving the increasingly complex policy issues of the 21st century run by an agile, high-performing team of dedicated individuals, with efficient and effective processes in place;</li>
                    <li style="padding-bottom: 0.5em;">Impact Canada is <strong>on track</strong> to meet its strategic objectives and is <strong>well placed to lead and support policy priorities</strong> through the use of advanced policy research, behavioural science, and Challenge-based methods as evidenced by its substantial positive impact on numerous critical policy spheres;</li>
                    <li style="padding-bottom: 0.5em;">Impact Canada's Challenge program continues to <strong>fill a gap in the Canadian innovation ecosystem</strong>, experiencing rapid growth from 2 challenge streams valued at $375M to 30 active or completed outcomes-based funding projects valued over $735M, spanning economic, environmental, and social policy domains;</li>
                    <li style="padding-bottom: 0.5em;">Built upon world-leading data-driven models of research, Impact Canada's portfolio of behavioural science (BeSci) projects <strong>inform the design and implementation of priority programs, services, and initiatives</strong> - understanding human behaviour and decision-making in a real-world context to support the implementation of key government priorities;</li>
                    <li style="padding-bottom: 0.5em;">Feedback from departments via key informant interviews and surveys overwhelmingly emphasize the <strong>importance of Impact Canada's support, with high demand and satisfaction for Impact Canada's Centre of Expertise, Fellowship program, resources, and the Impact Canada portal;</strong></li>
                    <li style="padding-bottom: 0.5em;">Impact Canada is a <strong>positive story for government</strong>, demonstrating strong accountability, value for dollar, and concrete results for Canadians; and</li>
                    <li style="padding-bottom: 0.5em;">Impact Canada is an <strong>effective approach that should be scaled up</strong> more broadly across government.</li>

                        </p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>A game-changing device that can accurately and quickly test illegal street drugs for multiple substances, including hard-to-detect fentanyl. Since winning the grand prize of $1M, the Scatr founders have improved their ability to manage operational and purchasing costs by developing the technology in-house, purchasing a 3D printer and other critical equipment, and making improvements to their sample library and digital display. Never having applied for funding from the GC in the past, Scatr pivoted work they were completing on a blood-typing device to align with this important need – an example of the ability of Challenges to attract new solvers, create new technologies, and impact societal outcomes – reducing opioid overdose and death due to fentanyl poisoning.</li>
                          <br />
                          <li>A mining technology designed to selectively break particles and sort waste from desired minerals, reducing crushing and grinding requirements and reaching over 35 percent energy savings across several commodities.</li>
                          <br />
                          <li>A battery technology for storing energy in zinc metal. Its low-cost, flexible, and long-duration energy storage solution could help increase the share of the world's energy markets powered by renewable energy.</li>
                          <br />
                          <li>A bio jet fuel that converts municipal solid waste, as well as forestry and agricultural biomass, into sustainable chemicals and advanced biofuels, including sustainable aviation fuel.</li>
                          <br />
                          <li>Indigenous housing innovation resulting in the building of an eight-unit residential facility that provides safe, transitional, emergency housing with professional and culturally sensitive support for community members escaping violence. The facility also includes six hotel units accessible from a separate entrance for those visiting the community to generate revenue to support the operation and maintenance.</li>
                        </ul>
                        &nbsp;
                        <p>The success of Impact Canada Challenges has led to a substantial increase in the number of interested partner departments and organizations. The Challenge portfolio of projects and programs has grown significantly, from 2 program streams in 2017 valued at $375M to now over $730M in funding for 30 initiatives.
                        </p>
                        <p>In implementing a diverse portfolio of challenges, Impact Canada has helped prove this method in several domains. Based on key lessons learned to date, Impact Canada has begun to cluster challenges in select priority policy areas to accelerate progress:
                        </p>
                        <ul>

                          <p>In the coming year, together with Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, Impact Canada will be launching a challenge looking to advance innovative, low-cost and scalable practices and technologies that contribute to the net reduction of enteric methane emissions from cattle. Up to twenty semi-finalists will be awarded up to $250,000 each. Ten finalists will receive up to $500,000 each. In the end, two winners will receive up to $1 million each to grow and commercialize their solution. All semi-finalists and finalists will also benefit from non-financial investments such as mentorship, trainings, and access to facilities.

                        </h4>
                        <p>A critical component of the Impact Canada Challenge design and delivery methodology is to use “non-financial” incentives to support innovators as they progress through challenge stages, ranging from access to Government science and technology (S&amp;T) experts or infrastructure, regulators, business development, communication supports, networking, and engagement across the cohort. Impact Canada innovators highly value these types of incentives, which are built into the challenge design. A survey administered to all Impact Canada Challenge applicants, jurors and lead departments clearly demonstrated that the further an innovator progresses through their Challenge, the more highly they rate the non-financial incentives in terms of value.
                        </p>
                        <div class="well" style="margin-top:20px;">
                          <p><strong>Non-Financial Incentives</strong>
                            <br />
                            During the Challenge design process, Impact Canada works with partners to determine Challenge assessment criteria and judging tools, as well as plans to validate innovator data or results submitted, or to generate new data in order to aid solution assessment. For example, innovators in the Deep Space Food Challenge have access to testing on their food products, nutritional qualities, palatability, and safety. Innovators have access to northern/remote heath-care sites and practitioners as required. In a second example, the Boat Hull Design Challenge, innovators had access to National Research Council's marine testing lab to build and test scale models of their proposed solutions. This testing is supported by the host department of the Challenge, in accordance with the Challenge budget. Impact Canada will continue to encourage and support the use of non-financial incentives to test and validate solutions and continue to broker helpful partnerships to facilitate this.
                          </p>
                          <p><strong>Potential area for improvement</strong>
                            <br />
                            Evaluation findings indicated that an area for improvement is increasing these types of non-financial incentives, including more access to Government of Canada facilities for more frequent non-graded testing opportunities. This evidence, along with findings indicating interest by the majority of participants in capacity building, coaching and mentoring (68%), and that significantly fewer respondents (26%) have secured post-Challenge investments, suggests a future area of work for consideration could be exploring and linking participants to increased testing facilities during Challenges and post-Challenge support leveraging government programming.

                        <p>There is evidence that Impact Canada challenges have contributed to mobilizing new talent to solve complex problems. Nearly one fourth of participants indicated that the Challenge was the sole motivation for them to work on the specific problem area and an additional 48% indicated that the Challenge motivated them to work on the problem to a large extent. Impact Canada Challenges are succeeding in attracting a wide range of applicants – at the time of application only about half are businesses, 22% are not-for-profits, and 18% are groups of individuals. Among applicants, more than two thirds have never applied to government funding before. Impact Canada Challenges have a higher proportion of women-owned and youth-owned businesses than the average in the Canadian economy. There is also a relatively large proportion of Impact Canada applicants that are visible minorities, indigenous and persons living with a disability.

                        <p>Results indicate that the Impact Canada Challenge model is an effective policy approach for delivering on government priorities and intended outcomes. Overall, the majority of jury members and departments indicate that a Challenge was the appropriate mechanism to address the problem area to a very large or large extent, indicating that the authorities / Terms &amp; Conditions that allow for Challenges are useful tools in the Government of Canada's toolkit, alongside other tools such as the Generic Terms &amp; Conditions, for departments working towards solving complex problems. Most notably, findings indicate that implementation supports, such as the Centre of Expertise, Impact Canada Platform, and Fellowship program, supporting departments to launch and run Challenges are critical to implementation and impact.
                        </p>
                        <p>Overall, there is high demand for Impact Canada advisory services with the majority of departments placing a high value on advice from Impact Canada on applying Impact Canada Terms and Conditions, implementing outcomes-based funding, understanding how to use Challenges as a tool to achieve policy and program objectives, and sharing best practices. Since inception, there has been an increase in the extent departments have sought support from Impact Canada to design and implement Challenges, as well as a significant increase in the use of resources and materials developed by Impact Canada. Moreover, levels of satisfaction with Impact Canada support have been increasing over the years – with 100% satisfaction reporting in 2021 - in part because of the high value placed on team expertise and advice, as well as the use of the Impact Canada portal by departments and jury members.

                        <p>Within government, the majority of departments indicated that the use of a Challenge contributed to strengthening staff capacity to a large or very large extent, by encouraging staff and departments to be more innovative in their work. Most departments also believed that following their experience with Challenges, department staff have greater readiness to work on similar programs in the future. Challenges have also been effective in increasing government engagement with stakeholders, including expanding the department's network of stakeholders and partners, in part due to the use of an external jury. Both departments and jury members indicated the importance of Challenges in bringing a greater diversity of perspectives into government decision-making, higher credibility and recognition to solutions, better aligning funding with industry needs, and increasing transparency/ democratizing funding decision-making.

                        <p>In the early years of the IIU, focus was placed on running proof-of-concept trials alongside socializing the discipline within the federal public service. From 2017-19, the IIU ran six demonstration projects - the majority of which were field experiments – that showcased the value of the application of behavioural science insights, and the science's ability to improve public program implementation.

                        <p>At the request of the Deputy Clerk and Deputy Minister of Health, the IIU rapidly pivoted to support the Government of Canada's COVID-19 response at the earliest stages of he pandemic. Recognizing that human behaviour was at the core of the pandemic response, for example, willingness to comply with public health measures, the IIU undertook advanced policy research resulting in a world-leading behavioural science program that helped inform the Government's policy, communication and program efforts (i.e., adherence to public health measures, vaccination acceptance and uptake, borders, misinformation and disinformation, etc.).

                          <p>Impact Canada played and continues to play an important role in supporting the government'ss COVID-19 response. At the outset of the pandemic, the team launched a large (n=2,000) longitudinal tracking study to better understand the evolving knowledge, risk perceptions and behaviours of Canadians over the course of the pandemic. Data collected underwent rapid analysis and dissemination (e.g. CPHO, Health Minister, NACI, PTs, etc.) to support decision-making in the pandemic response:
                          </p>
                          <ul>
                            <li>Longitudinal data acted as 'early warning' signals (e.g. vaccine hesitancy before vaccines approved; misinformation);</li>
                            <li>Behavioural science insights on vaccine hesitancy, mask-wearing and importation risk directly informed policy development, program interventions and communications (e.g. vaccine deep dive study informed MC on vaccine injury compensation program; behaviourally-informed border signage at POEs);</li>
                            <li>Increased understanding of the importance of operational transparency and trusted messengers informed strategic communications/communicators; and</li>
                            <li>Advanced statistical modelling produced novel behavioural profiles which showed strong predictors of outcomes compared to traditional demographic characteristics allowing for tailored interventions (e.g. identification of moveable middle).</li>

                        <p>In September 2021, in partnership with Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) and Natural Resources Canada (NRCan), the Impact and Innovation Unit launched a multi-year program of research on climate change. The Program of Applied Research on Climate Action in Canada (PARCA) applies behavioural science (BeSci) insights and methods with robust policy analysis to support climate and environmental action by generating evidence on how Canadians think, feel, and act in response to climate change, its impacts, and related Government policies, programs, and communications. Activities include scoping and population-based research to understand the national context, in-depth studies in key policy areas to evaluate specific challenges and opportunities, and in-field experimentation to test solutions before scaling. PARCA's Longitudinal Study has now completed its eighth and final wave of data collection, and planning is underway for ongoing national surveying.

                          <p><strong>The PARCA Longitudinal Study</strong>
                            <br />
                            Beginning in December of 2021, Impact Canada implemented a longitudinal study (public opinion research) with a large and nationally representative sample of Canadians to gather data and track changes over time in how Canadians think, feel, and act in response to climate change and its impacts. The robust, quantitative evidence generated by this study has helped to identify where there is potential for promoting greater individual climate and environmental action, and build support for stronger collective action.
                          </p>
                          <p>There have now been 8 data collection waves (December 2021 to March 2023). Results indicate that while Canadians widely express belief in climate change, a troubling proportion of those who believe in it still express confusion about its human causes. This has a significant implication for government policies and interventions that rely on understanding that link (e.g., programs that encourage people to take pro-climate actions that reduce their carbon footprint; support for carbon pricing). Advanced statistical analyses also identified, for instance, five unique ways in which Canadians think about climate change, as well as an implicit trade-off that Canadians make between environment-focused and economic-focused policies.
                          </p>
                          <p><strong>Key trends and signals from Wave 8 include:</strong>
                          </p>
                          <ul>
                            <li>Belief in climate change has remained high and stable, while risk perceptions have varied and appear linked to extreme weather events. Willingness to act, the perceived impact of individual actions, and perceived social norms have fluctuated, but all have declined over time.</li>
                            <li>Canadians value the repairability of home appliances, power tools, and other electronics, and overwhelmingly support a right-to-repair law. Among four home energy saving measures, respondents are more willing to engage in those they see as more effective; however, their perceptions of effectiveness notably differ from expert judgments.</li>
                            <li>Two thirds of Canadians say they have experienced more extreme weather than usual in the past two years, with higher levels among respondents living in BC and the Atlantic provinces. Only one fifth of Canadians think their communities are prepared for climate change, but twice as many think their households are prepared. Three quarters have a cooling system in their home, the most common adaptation-related feature. Over 40% have experienced first- or second-hand wildfire impacts in the past two years, but most have taken no wildfire-related actions and are not familiar with the FireSmart program.</li>
                            <li>Most Canadians think of carbon pricing as costing their households more than they receive in payments, but people express more support for a carbon pricing system that uses revenues to fund environmental projects instead of making payments to households (i.e., the current approach).</li>
                            <li>Only a third of Canadians trust the federal government to make good decisions on climate change. Even among those who believe in climate change and/or are worried about it, fewer than half trust the government on the issue.</li>
                          </ul>
                          &nbsp;
                          <p>Plans are now well underway for ongoing national surveying that will continue to track changes in the national context over time, establish baseline data for new and emerging topics, analyze key factors predicting intentions, behaviours, and policy support, and track changes over time in attitude-based segments of the Canadian population. Ongoing national surveying will comprise two survey series: (1) a tracking series fielded once every three months, with a pre-established set of questions, and (2) an emerging topics series fielded as needed, comprising 2-4 topics of timely value to PARCA partners. The first tracking series is expected to launch in June 2023.

                        <p>PARCA's Behavioural Science Fellows have now designed and launched 8 rapid online studies or Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) with large samples of Canadians (N = 2,000+ per study) to examine drivers of and barriers to specific pro-environmental behaviours identified as priorities by departmental policy leads. Topics include heat pump adoption among homeowners and landlords, zero emission vehicle adoption, leveraging emotions in climate change communications, home energy labelling, home energy retrofits, and eco-product labelling. Behavioural Science Fellows have also conducted qualitative interviews and surveys to understand drivers and barriers to engagement in government programs.

                          In January 2023, small teams of IIU Behavioural Science Fellows began planning a series of in-field studies designed and implemented in collaboration with trusted partners, internal and external to Government, to test behavioural science-informed solutions in real-world settings. These projects will continue throughout 2023 and into 2024. Effective solutions will be prioritized for scaling up. Projects are currently in development related to three high-impact climate topics: heat pump adoption, zero emission vehicle adoption, and climate literacy.

                        </h3>
                        <p>In continued partnership with PHAC, the IIU launched the Trust, Information, and Digital Ecosystems Study (TIDES), a multi-wave survey examining the role and impact of public trust and misinformation across policy priorities such as public health, climate action, and immigration. TIDES will offer a mechanism to build generalizable knowledge within and across policy contexts by examining several issue domains in a singular study, including new domains (e.g., public health beyond COVID-19, new environment and climate change topics, and immigration and citizenship). It will be comprised of four waves, collecting data from a cross-sectional sample of 3,500 Canadians per wave using a probability-based sampling approach. At the culmination of the study, the sample will comprise 14,000 distinct Canadians.

                            To date, 2 data collection waves (December 2022 and March 2023) have provided valuable insights into stressors to trust in government, news consumption habits, and information literacy. Key findings include:
                          </p>
                          <ul>
                            <li>Confidence in Canada's democracy was the strongest predictor of trust in the Government of Canada (higher confidence predicts more trusting). However, confidence is relatively low. Most do not trust government to make good decisions.</li>
                            <li>A range of measures related to democratic confidence and democratic health show worrying signs that warrant further analysis, including: over half of respondents do not feel like they have a voice in Canada's democracy, only 12% say that people like them have a significant influence on politics, and 18% of participants do not report supporting the outcome of Canadian elections, regardless of the winner.</li>
                            <li>Resistance to misinformation was a strong predictor of trust in the Government of Canada (higher resistance predicts more trusting).</li>
                            <li>Many in Canada are unaware of social media algorithms and their influence on the content they are presented with online.</li>
                            <li>COVID-19- and climate-related misinformation remain prevalent and impact different communities unequally (e.g., individuals identifying as 2SLGBTQI+ report encountering misinformation online more frequently than others but demonstrate better discernment of reliable information from misinformation related to COVID-19 and climate change).</li>
                            <li>Applying a machine learning-based approach for population segmentation, individuals exhibiting the lowest use of all information sources on average (particularly government and news media) were found to have the highest conspiratorial mindset and significantly greater susceptibility to misinformation across multiple topic areas (COVID-19, climate change, and immigration).</li>
                          </ul>
                        </div>
                        <p>The Behavioural Science Office and Office of Public Confidence in the Public Health Agency of Canada, supported by the IIU, are also examining the relationship between trust in public health institutions and belief in health and public health misinformation among young adults in Canada (aged 18–30) via a series of focus groups.

                          <p>To better understand and reduce the spread of misinformation with insights and tools from behavioural science, in partnership with the OECD, behavioural science experts from&nbsp;<a href="https://impact.canada.ca/en/behavioural-science/timeline">Impact Canada</a>&nbsp;and from the French Direction interministérielle de la transformation publique (<a href="https://www.transformation.gouv.fr/">DITP</a>) launched a first-of-its-kind international collaboration. This exercise in sharing best practices between governments and academics initiated a study conducted in Canada using a randomised controlled trial – embedded within the longitudinal&nbsp;<a href="https://impact.canada.ca/en/cosmo-canada">COVID-19 Snapshot Monitoring Study COSMO Canada</a>.
                          </p>
                          <p>The study, published in 2022, tested on 1,872 people across Canada, assessed the impact of two behaviourally-informed interventions – an attention accuracy prompt and a set of digital media literacy tips – on intentions to share true and false news headlines about COVID-19 on social media. <a href="https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/governance/an-international-effort-using-behavioural-science-to-tackle-the-spread-of-misinformation_b7709d4f-en">https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/governance/an-international-effort-using-behavioural-science-to-tackle-the-spread-of-misinformation_b7709d4f-en</a>

                          </h3>
                        </summary>
                        <p>The findings from Impact Canada's applied research have been integrated across a multitude of Government of Canada governance bodies, at the most senior levels, both within the Privy Council Office and departments, feeding into Government of Canada and Provincial-Territorial decision-making at the highest levels. This experience has shifted the IIU's operating model in a new and impactful way. The IIU's role sits in an otherwise unoccupied space – supporting both PCO's mandate, as well as generating evidence and providing advice to key federal organizations, other orders of government, non-governmental stakeholders, and international organizations.

                  <h2>4.3 Overall Conclusions
                  </h2>
                  <p>The comprehensive evaluation concluded that Impact Canada is well placed to lead and support policy priorities through the use of advanced policy research, behavioural science, and Challenge-based funding models, and that it has successfully delivered on its strategic objectives to date. Further, the review concluded that there were no serious gaps in documented processes with respect to effectiveness and efficiency.
                  </p>
                  <p>Impact Canada is regarded as an important asset within the ecosystem that can be leveraged in a strategic manner and as such is working to fulfil demands from departments to support agricultural climate change solutions, future advances and challenges in health care (e.g., innovations in personal testing, antimicrobial resistance), space exploration and utilization solutions, and adoption of digital technology by small and medium enterprises.
                  </p>
                  <p>It represents a unique and effective approach to solving the increasingly complex policy issues of the 21st century run by an agile, high-performing team of dedicated individuals, with efficient and effective processes in place.
                  </p>
                  <p>The evaluation also highlighted that both the Challenge model and the behavioural science approach have produced substantial, visible and positive outcomes in numerous critical policy spheres that include public health, climate action, online misinformation, and infrastructure among others.
